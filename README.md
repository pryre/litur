Key developments include a range of novel techniques to generate and track practically feasible trajectories, recover from large disturbances, and the ability to perform complex manipulation tasks. The framework is an important step towards safe and reliable aerial manipulation.},

#### Package Name

The name `litur` is short for "Liturgusidae", which, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgusidae):

> Liturgusidae is a family of praying mantids in the new (2019) Neotropical superfamily Acanthopoidea. A substantial number of genera, previously placed here, have recently been moved to the new or revived other families.
